# Tic-Tac-Toe

A beginner's Tic Tac Toe implementation in Python 3

Rules:
- The players take turns to place a tile wherever they want
- You can't put two tiles in the same cell
- The first player who gets 3 in a row wins

How to play:
- Let the program know where do you want to place your tile choosing your column with the letters A, B or C, and your row with 1, 2, 3. For example, if I want to place my tile on the first cell of the first row I would type 'A1'.
